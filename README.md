# CR reverse engineering

Another try to recreate a famous game. This time Clash Royale.
I was able to recreate different classe's behaviour including path-finding (grounded and airborn / building focus or not)
I was also able to make the card cycle system and elexir cost.
I experimented scriptable objects for the first time and found how usefull they can be.
I experimented with shaders also to make the fireball texture.
Also tried to make something that looks better, modeling the canon, the towers and some arena assets, using blender.

What is missing:
End game when king tower down.
Update placing card zone when tower down.
! Most important ! : no ai from opponent, just cards placed at the start.

This project's purpose was mostly to leard and experiment with new things (path-finding, scriptable objects, 3d modeling ...). I may continue but I prefer to work on new things rather than continuing to copy from CR. 

Disclamer : 
The card's image are not my work, they are all from SUPERCELL. And the balloon model is also not mine, I found it on sketchfab (can't find it anymore to credit).
